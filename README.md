# RoboticFactory
extension for robotic factory
The model embodies an enduring autonomous robot factory predicated on the principles of self-organization ubiquitously evident in natural systems. The model is of a garment production line that's fully automated yet tethered to a volatile external environment â€“ the suppliers. The autonomous robots transport products across different machines before loading them onto vehicles for delivery. As species deeply rooted in the interconnected biosphere, bees and ants exemplify extraordinary efficiency and resilience in self-organization, a trait that humans could learn to integrate into their systems. We should strive towards creating human systems that are as robust as nature, epitomized in this model.

Considering the Factory: An Emergent or Sequential Procedure?
In order to reinvent resilient human systems, we must transition from the predominantly sequential systems, characteristic of the industrial age, to emergent processes, a prevalent phenomenon in nature. According to Chi et al. (2012), processes can be dichotomized into either sequential or emergent. Sequential processes can be dissected into an order of events, analogous to an assembly line where raw metal is transformed through a series of operations: rolling, pressing, stamping, and smoothing, before being converted into cans that are subsequently filled with tomato sauce. In this example, there are multiple actors: the machines, the operators, and a manager. In sequential processes, it is reasonable to attribute the outcome to the actions of a single agent. For instance, one might conclude that the manager enhanced the assembly line's efficiency by accelerating the conveyor belt's speed. While every actor contributes to the process, one could focus on the actions of the manager, the goal-setter, to explain the change. Thus, as Chi et al. suggest, in a sequential process, one can assign superior controlling status to the agent inducing the change. This implies that when someone perceives a process as sequential, they tend to interpret interactions at the agent level as intended to accomplish the higher-level goal (Wilensky & Resnick, 1999). This perspective is fitting for an assembly line, where the resultant mechanism originates from the accumulation of outcomes directed by the manager. However, this perspective can result in misinterpretations when applied to emergent systems like ant colonies, leading to mistaken assumptions such as attributing queen ants with commanding roles. Such a misunderstanding of control within emergent processes is referred to as "Levels Confusion" by Wilensky & Resnick.

Emergent processes, on the other hand, like ants foraging for food, maintaining orderly paths, or blocking entrances, are distinct. These processes result from individual ants taking certain actions, some of which are random, with the outcome manifesting through the repetition of these actions, devoid of any controlling agent. Such processes are exemplified in academic standards like osmosis, diffusion, electrical current, and buoyancy.

This model reimagines a factory as an emergent process, in contrast to a sequential one, offering a pioneering layout for a factory floor. The model is emergent because the operational efficiencies are derived from managing emergent parameters rather than processes within the factory. Here, key characteristics are established to shape the emergent pattern of the model: the energy cycle. This represents an instance of humans architecting an emergent system to meet business requirements.
